# SfM-MVS photogrammetry tips
-------------

**This repository provides useful explanations, references, links and scripts to help you perform Structure-from-Motion Mutli-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry with the software [Agisoft Metashape Pro](https://www.agisoft.com/).**  

This repository is in construction, but you can already find a [first draft of user-guide](https://github.com/GeoRiskA/SfM-MVS_photogrammetry_tips/blob/main/User_Guide_v100.md) to help you use Metashape Pro, as well as Python scripts for Metashape Pro (see [python_scripts_for_Metashape](https://github.com/GeoRiskA/SfM-MVS_photogrammetry_tips/tree/main/python_scripts_for_Metashape) folder)
